    "The goal of this analysis was to identify luls in traffic for the purposes of replacing turnstiles with updated models. Ideally, all turnstiles will be replaced with minimal impact on the daily commutes of riders. Analysis was done on the available data from 2019 to get a more realistic view of traffic before the current pandemic."

Simple graphing of the overall average, by month, allowed an understanding of general traffic patterns for the city. The same graph was recreated using only the highest and lowest stations "

The data sampled for this project was the first week listed for every month fo 2019 in attempts to understand traffic for a pre-pandemic landscape. Afther proper coalating, January first 2019 was chosen as the initial cumulative totals, then totals for the end of every month were collected to attain monthly totals. "

A lot of wasted time was spent on searcing datetime indexing with the 'resample' method, in conjunction with other pandas datetime methods. A considerable amount of time was also spent creating a proper pivot table, showing each individual turnstile in its own row, followed by several merged columns showing new entries and exits by month.\n",
