Combing through the MTA data has proved more difficult than initially anticipated. It has taken a while to aggregate totals based on both turnstile and stat
for the month. After many failed attempts we have successfully coallated all totals into a pivot table, that show each tunstile's monthly totals. The pivot table
can also be easily aggregated by station to show station totals. Only preliminary analysis has been acheived at this point due to errors in aggregating early in the
process. Plotting from a pivot table has also proved to be different than a regular data set, but the table inside the repo does show traffic totals by turnstile,
by month. While we hoped to be further along at this point, the data is finally in a good placce to compare. The accompanying chartis included in the repository as

This MVP is preliminary and being submitted early based on time constraints. It will be updated later today as better graphical infromation is created.
