EDA Project Proposal

In continuing the City of New York’s efforts to keep subway stations up to date, it is the objective of this group to identify best times to perform repairs and replacements. We hope to replace all terminals with updated RFID sensors allowing ease of access for all riders, while minimizing the impact on rider’s commutes. Using the data provided by the MTA for all of 2019, we hope to identify which times are best for each region, looking at time of day, week of the month, and month of the year. We also plan to identify stations with multiple turnstiles to see if certain stations can be updated during peak hours by working on only one terminal at a time. The data will be downloaded and concatenated using SQLite. Initial exploratory analysis will be done to ensure clean, full data that is useful for our objective. This data will then be imported to Jupyter for further analyzing using Pandas. Utilizing both Matplotlib and Seaborn, we plan to graphically highlight the results, showing stations monthly traffic for the year using bar graphs, and even showing the percentage of traffic for each station, or each terminal within a station. The results of this study should provide a clear understanding of traffic patterns, allowing us to plan replacements of all terminals.
